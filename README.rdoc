= Accountable

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

== Usage

The core of accountable are Accounts and AccountableTransactions.  The concept of an account is probably familiar to most developers-- think of your checking or savings accounts.  A transaction links two accounts together, posting a debit to one, and a credit to another.  The credits and debits must be equal in amount.  That's it!

The system also includes invoices, payments, and the ability to mark any eligible transaction as payment for an invoice, as long as the buyer's account is involved in the transaction.

== Installation

bundle install
rails g accountable:migrations
