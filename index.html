<p>== Usage</p>

<p>The core of accountable are Accounts and Transactions.  The concept of an account is probably familiar to most developers-- think of your checking or savings accounts.  A transaction links two accounts together, posting a debit to one, and a credit to another.  The credits and debits must be equal in amount.  That's it!</p>

<p>The system also includes invoices, payments, and the ability to mark any eligible transaction as payment for an invoice, as long as the buyer's account is involved in the transaction.</p>

<p>== Installation</p>

<p>Gemfile
bundle install
rails g accountable:migrations
rake db:migrate</p>
