{"body":"= Accountable\r\n\r\nThis project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.\r\n\r\n== Usage\r\n\r\nThe core of accountable are Accounts and Transactions.  The concept of an account is probably familiar to most developers-- think of your checking or savings accounts.  A transaction links two accounts together, posting a debit to one, and a credit to another.  The credits and debits must be equal in amount.  That's it!\r\n\r\nThe system also includes invoices, payments, and the ability to mark any eligible transaction as payment for an invoice, as long as the buyer's account is involved in the transaction.\r\n\r\n== Installation\r\n\r\nGemfile\r\nbundle install\r\nrails g accountable:migrations\r\nrake db:migrate\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
